BCILAB
======

MATLAB Toolbox for Brain-Computer Interface Research

This software was written at the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience, UCSD. This work was funded by the Army Research Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-10-2-0022 and a gift from The Swartz Foundation (Old Field, NY).
The design of BCILAB was inspired by a preceding toolbox (the PhyPA toolbox) written in 2006-'09 by C. Kothe with contributions from T. Zander at the Department for Human-Machine Systems, Berlin Institute of Technology.

This toolbox is no longer actively developped as of 2017. However, critical updates are still performed. If you are interested in further developping and maintaining BCILAB, feel free to contact us.
